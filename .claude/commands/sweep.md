Use the code-quality-sweep agent to perform a full code quality audit on this repository.

Scan the entire codebase, detect the technology stack(s), and run all 6 sweep categories:
1. Dead Code & Unused Dependencies
2. Code Style & Consistency
3. Error Handling & Resilience
4. Security & Secrets
5. Test Quality & Coverage
6. Architecture & Scalability
7. Monorepo Hygiene (only if monorepo structure detected)

For each category with findings, make the fixes directly and provide a summary report.
Also generate the Architecture Assessment in docs/ARCHITECTURE_ASSESSMENT.md.
